This repository is dedicated to automating the data preprocessing process, making it easier and more efficient. It supports various functions to streamline your data preparation tasks, including:

- **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert categorical variables into numerical format suitable for machine learning.

- **Normalization:** Scale your data to a common range for consistent modeling.

- **Column Dropping:** Easily remove unnecessary columns from your dataset.

- **Missing Value Handling:** Provides methods for filling missing values and reporting on missing data columns.

More functions are in development and will be added soon to further enhance your data preprocessing capabilities.
